    "If a function contains at least one yield statement (it may contain other yield or return statements), it becomes a generator function. Both yield and return will return some value from a function.\n",

    "- When called, it returns an object (iterator) but does not start execution immediately.\n",

    "- Once the function yields, the function is paused and the control is transferred to the caller.\n",
    "- Local variables and their states are remembered between successive calls.\n",
    "- Finally, when the function terminates, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.\n",
